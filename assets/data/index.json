To beat burnout, we needed a mission that would inspire a sustainable commitment to community care. So we put our heads together and ideated around a way forward, with a focus on rooting anti-racism work in joy rather than outrage or obligation.\n\nWith that principle in mind, we started working on a new direction for Outer Work. Drawing on the idea of the work being “rooted” we started to think about the organization in the context of a community garden, a place where people come together to combine their strengths and grow something beautiful and new. Working from that vision, we decided that more than a pure brand exercise, Outer Work needed a way to physically touch people’s lives. We also wanted to get it into as many hands as possible, which meant finding the most cost-effective option.
